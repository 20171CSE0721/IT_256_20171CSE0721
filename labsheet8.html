<h1>About Dwayne Johnson</h1>
<p id="firstpara">
<br />Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name, The Rock, is an American-Canadian actor, producer, investor and retired professional wrestler.[9] Johnson was a professional wrestler for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide,[10] making Johnson one of the most successful and highest-grossing box-office stars of all time.[11]

Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, with whom he won a national championship in 1991. He initially aspired for a professional career in football and entered the 1995 NFL Draft, but he went undrafted. As a result, Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but was cut from the team in the middle of his first season. Shortly after, he began training as a professional wrestler.[12] 
Dwayne Douglas Johnson was born on May 2, 1972,[30] in Hayward, California,[31] to Ata Johnson (née Maivia; born 1948)[32] and former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles; 1944–2020).[33][34] Growing up, Johnson briefly lived in New Zealand with his mother's family,[35] where he attended Richmond Road Primary School in Grey Lynn before returning to the United States.[35] He then attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina before moving to Hamden, Connecticut, where he spent a couple of years at Shepherd Glen Elementary School and Hamden Middle School.[36][37] Johnson spent his high school years at President William McKinley High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, Glencliff High School and McGavock High School in Nashville, Tennessee, and Freedom High School in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.[38] He was arrested multiple times for fighting, theft, and check fraud before the age of 17.[39] Johnson also began playing sports, joining his high schools' gridiron football, track and field and wrestling teams.[33]

In 1996, Johnson secured a contract with the WWF and was promoted as the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history, as he is the son of Rocky Johnson and grandson of Peter Maivia. He rose to prominence after developing a charismatic persona of a boastful trash-talking wrestler named The Rock. He subsequently won his first WWF Championship in 1998 and helped usher the WWF into the "Attitude Era", a boom period in the company's business in the latter 1990s and early 2000s which still hold professional wrestling records for television ratings.[13] In 2004, he left the WWE to pursue an acting career and went on a seven-year hiatus before returning in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, before wholly retiring in 2019.

Considered to be one of the greatest professional wrestlers and biggest draws of all-time,[14][15] The Rock headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever, WrestleMania XXVIII, and was featured in among the most watched episodes of WWE's television shows, WWE Raw and WWE SmackDown.[16][17] He has won several championships, being a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time tag team champion, and a ten-time world champion.[18] He was also a Royal Rumble match winner and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. 
Johnson was a promising football prospect and received offers from many Division I collegiate programs. He decided on a full scholarship from the University of Miami where he mostly played defensive tackle. In 1991, he was on the Miami Hurricanes' national championship team.[40][33] After suffering a number of injuries, he was later replaced in the starting lineup by future Pro Football Hall of Famer Warren Sapp.[41]

After Johnson graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of General Studies in criminology and physiology,[42] he signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League as a linebacker. He was assigned to the practice roster but was cut two months into the season.[33][43][44]

He debuted on Monday Night Raw as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996.[49] His first match came at Survivor Series, on November 17, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, Crush and Goldust.[50] On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on Monday Night Raw.[51][52][53] Maivia then successfully defended the title against Helmsley at In Your House 13: Final Four. He had his first WrestleMania match at WrestleMania 13 where he was victorious in his Intercontinental Championship defense against The Sultan. WWF fans started to reject his character and push from the company.[54] He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on the March 31 episode of Raw is War.[55] Behind the scenes, Hart mentored Johnson for his first year in WWF[56] and refused to be booked to take the title from him.[57] On April 20, at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout but retained the title. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of "die, Rocky, die" and "Rocky sucks" being heard during his matches.[4][47]
